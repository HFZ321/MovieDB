# MovieDB
### Intro
This is the project that I did during my training with Apolis.
### App functionality 
The app requires 6 or more digit email and 6 or more password to login to the movie list screen. The movie list screen pass the information about the movie and the picture through api. The search bar on the navigation bar will search the movie name according to the title. When press on any cell on the table, the screen will direct to the detail screen to show bigger image and text.
